# Incompatible Hardware

⚠️Before updating, it is strongly recommended you read the reasons that you may not want to update unsupported hardware [here](/issues/incompatible-hardware.md) ⚠️

With the release of Windows 11, Microsoft has heavily upped the hardware requirements. When installing Windows 11 through regular means, you may receive an undismissable error such as: \
![TPM & SECUREBOOT ERROR](https://github.com/ArkaneDev/WinPass11/blob/guided/WinPass11Guided/assets/TpmError.png?raw=true)

If instead you receive an error like this: \
![DISMISSABLE ERROR](https://i3g4v6w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/windows-11-setup-requirement-warning.webp) \
You can simply click "Accept" and continue updating.

In the event you receive the first error, you can use [WinPass11](https://github.com/ArkaneDev/WinPass11/releases) to bypass the error, though if you don't plan to use Insider, make sure you download a Windows 11 ISO image first from [Microsoft's Website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)
