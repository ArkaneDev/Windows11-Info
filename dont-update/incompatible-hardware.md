# Incompatible Hardware
Though it may be trivial to bypass the restrictions to update to Windows 11, there are reasons which you may want to refrain from doing so.

If you update to Windows 11, you are no longer entitled to revieve updates. 
Does this mean you wont? No it means that microsoft doesn't *have* to update your machine anymore and that they can at any time cut you off

You may expirience more instability than people who use Windows 11 on supported hardware. 
Microsoft hasn't tested and ironed out bugs that may affect unsupported hardware.

It may void your computers warranty (if still covered) to update through unoffical means. Read through your agreement if you care about warranty.

If despite all of this, you still want to update to Windows 11, go to [Updating to Windows 11 on unsupported hardware](/issues/incompatible-hardware.md)
