## Incompatible Hardware
Though it may be trivial to bypass the restrictions to update to Windows 11, there are reasons for which you may want to refrain from doing so.

If you update to Windows 11, you are no longer entitled to receive updates. 
Does this mean you won't? No, it just means that Microsoft no longer *has* to update your machine and can cut you off at any time.

You may experience instability more frequently than people who use Windows 11 on supported hardware. 
Microsoft hasn't tested and ironed out bugs that may affect unsupported hardware.

It may void your computer's warranty (if still covered) to update through unofficial means. Read through your agreement if you care about warranty.

If despite all of this, you still want to update to Windows 11, go to [Updating to Windows 11 on unsupported hardware](/issues/incompatible-hardware.md).
